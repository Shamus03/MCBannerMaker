A horrbily inefficient yet completely functional banner maker for Minecraft.

The actual coding took around an hour, but putting each pattern in manually took around 4-5 hours of work after that.

I'd be happy to receive any help with visual improvements, optimizations, or even a complete rebase (since the code is horrific at the moment).  Just send a pull request!


One feature I'm hoping to add is a way to get instructions on how to make the pattern you have designed.  This would mean adding the recipes for each pattern as well.  Perhaps the user would click a button, and a new window with instructions would teach them how to create their banner in-game.
