A horrbile inefficient yet completely functional banner maker for Minecraft.

The actual coding took around an hour, but putting each pattern in manually took around 4-5 hours of work after that.

I'd be happy to receive any help with visual improvements, optimizations, or even a complete rebase (since the code is horrific at the moment).  Just send a pull request!
